"""
10-6. Addition: One common problem when prompting for numerical input occurs when people provide text instead of numbers. 
When you try to convert the input to an int, youâ€™ll get a TypeError. 
Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Add them together and print the result. 
Catch the TypeError if either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message. 
Test your program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a number.
